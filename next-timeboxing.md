The Timeboxing app. Here's a detailed breakdown of the features you mentioned, along with some potential implementation ideas:

1. Adding Multiple Timers
  - Users can add multiple timers to their dashboard. Each timer can be initiated independently of the other or in a group of timers.
  - Users can start, pause, and reset each timer individually.
2. Writing and Editing a Name for Each Timer
  - Each timer can have a custom name assigned by the user. This could be useful for differentiating between various tasks or activities.
  - Users can edit the name of each timer at any time.
3. Creating a Group of Timers and Selecting a Name for This Group
  - Users can create groups of timers for specific activities or projects. Each group can also have a custom name.
  - Users can add or remove timers from these groups as needed.
4. Specifying the Time for Timer
  - Users can set a specific duration for each timer. This could be done using a simple input field where users can enter the desired time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
5. Showing the Total Time of the Group of Timers
  - The app can automatically calculate and display the total time for each group of timers. This could be displayed at the top of each group for easy reference.
6. Ability to Remove Timers or Add a New One
  - Users can add new timers or remove existing ones. This provides flexibility in managing time for various tasks.
7. Notifications
  - The app could send notifications to the user when a timer ends. This could be a sound, a vibration, or a visual alert.
8. Timer History
  - The app could keep a history of each timer's usage. This could help users track their time usage over days, weeks, or months.
9. Sync Across Devices
  - If users use multiple devices, the app could sync their timers across all devices. This way, they can manage their timers no matter which device they're using.
